👋 Hi, I’m @KabaTubare - My childhood nickname, inspired by my love for Star Trek and the exploration of new frontiers, both in space and technology.
👀 I’m deeply interested in the cutting-edge fields of AI, MLOps, Voice Cloning, AI-enabled audiowatermarking, privacy protection technologies, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and the emerging concepts of Large Action Models (LAMs) and Large World Models (LWMs). These innovative models are redefining the capabilities of AI in understanding and performing human actions on computer applications with unprecedented precision.
🌱 I’m currently learning about the integration of neuro-symbolic programming in AI to enhance both the understanding and execution of complex tasks within digital environments. My journey also includes diving into the nuances of voice cloning to safeguard privacy and exploring the limitless possibilities of AGI.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what AI can achieve, from developing AI-driven solutions that improve customer engagement to pioneering the use of LAMs and LWMs in creating more intuitive and effective AI applications.
