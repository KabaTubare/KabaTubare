👋 Hi, I’m @KabaTubare - a name that harks back to my childhood when I created it, inspired by what I thought a Star Trek character's name might sound like. It's a nod to my lifelong fascination with exploration and innovation.
👀 I’m interested in AI, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), and leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance sales processes and customer engagement.
🌱 I’m currently learning about advanced AI models and their applications in improving sales and marketing performance, as well as diving deeper into the nuances of MLOps to streamline AI deployment in business operations.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects focused on developing AI-driven solutions, particularly chatbots and autonomous agents, and integrating AI tools to transform sales operations.

Plus, the name Kabatubare brings a piece of my imaginative childhood into my professional and creative endeavors.
