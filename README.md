👋 Hey there, I’m @KabaTubare. Picture this: a 9-year-old kid, eyes glued to the TV, watching Star Trek and dreaming up names for characters that could be roaming the galaxy. That's how Kabatubare came to be – my own addition to the crew, exploring the universe.

👀 My passions? AI, MLOps, Voice Cloning, AI-enabled audio watermarking, privacy protection technologies, and the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It's like being on an endless voyage through technology, discovering new planets of knowledge.

🌱 Right now, I'm diving deep into the mysteries of neuro-symbolic programming, Large Action Models (LAMs), and Large World Models (LWMs). These aren't just areas of study for me; they're the unknown territories I chart, seeking out new life and new civilizations in the universe of AI.

💞️ I'm on the lookout for fellow adventurers. If you're into creating AI that makes a difference, cracking the code of digital privacy, or simply love pushing the envelope, let's team up.

📫 Want to get in touch? Signal me on here and I will get back to you. Whether you're a fellow AI enthusiast, a tech innovator, or just someone who gets a kick out of turning imagination into reality, I'm up for it. 

😄 Pronouns: He/Him – because, why complicate things?

⚡ Fun fact: Inspired by the Starship Enterprise's mission, I set off on my own tech expedition, guided by a name that's a throwback to those after-school Star Trek sessions.
